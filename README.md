As my first Django project I chose online resume. As I'm not really experienced in frontend stuff I searched for a bootstrap template and found right on at https://startbootstrap.com/.

I made a Django project that would suit the template and what's most important I made several models so I could dynamically change data at django admin and so it woudn't be hardcoded in html file.

As a next step I tweaked a bit html and css file - color change, categories change, complete change of skills section etc.

At last I deployed the project with AWS and also made a PostgreSQL database there as a default DB for the project.
